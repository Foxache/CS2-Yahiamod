# CS2-Yahiamod
## A fun little port of Yahiamod for Counter Strike 2 using Counter Strike 2 Gamestate Intergration

## **The youtube video isnt made yet** , im just lazy and dont want to update it later.

> [!CAUTION]
> This mod is **HIGHLY unstable** at this point in time , and as such is in a "beta" phase as i add features and try to make the experience better.

> [!NOTE]
> This mod may increase lag as it works with CS:GSI over the network, trying to have real-time actions uses bandwidth.

# SETUP 

This is a **Python only project**, so python HAS to be installed.
You also **need PIP for the extra packages** , pip can be found on its native website.

Next , **you need to install all the Packages that Python needs** to run this project:
1) open a terminal window (search "terminal" or "cd")
2) Paste this command:
```
   py -m pip install tk pillow pynput pygame flask pyautogui winregistry vdf
```

Python packages are libraries for python to use , and are usually built in. yahiamod uses a lot of built in ones but some things are very neiche so need further specific packages. Heres what each one is:

- tk - Also known as TKinter , this is the library i use to make the overlays and visual effects
- pillow - Used to pre-load images to improve performance.
- pygame - A package used to make games in python, handy to play audio with!
- flask - Used by server.py to listen out for the CS GSI!
- winregistry - reading windows registries to find where Steam is located.
- vdf - Used for reading Valve (steam) files.

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the program crashes , it is likely one of these is missing!

Next you need to place the configuration file that Yahiamod uses to communicate with Counter strike.
Inside the project folder you will find "gamestate_integration_yahamouse" , this is the config file!
This needs to go into your Counter strike CFG directory. It should look like:

```
"SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"
```

Place "gamestate_integration_yahamouse.cfg" into this folder. 

> [!WARNING]
> if you have cs:go legacy installed , you might have multiple folders named cfg , try to follow this exact path.

Thats all for the setup!
